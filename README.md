#SpaceShooter Tutorial - Under Test

![header image](http://unity3d.com/sites/default/files/space-shooter-header_0.jpg)

The Unity SpaceShooter [tutorial](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter) - updated to support unit and integration testing.

I did this both as a learning example for other people to see unit testing in a practical setting using Unity - and selfishly as a project in order to explore Unity's testing capabilities.
