#SpaceShooter Tutorial - Under Test 
#(THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)

![header image](http://unity3d.com/sites/default/files/space-shooter-header_0.jpg)

The Unity SpaceShooter [tutorial](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter) - updated to support unit and integration testing.

I did this both as a learning example for other people to see unit testing in a practical setting using Unity - and selfishly as a project in order to explore Unity's testing capabilities.

I'm also using build scripts to automatically build the project using Travis-CI. My scripts are based on those found [here](https://jonathan.porta.codes/2015/04/17/automatically-build-your-unity3d-project-in-the-cloud-using-travisci-for-free/). Another project on GitHub is working down a similar path, consult it [here](https://github.com/MrSimbax/pong-x).
