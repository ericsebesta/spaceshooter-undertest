Current TODO list:

1. Add 1 unit test, get Travis-CI to run and only succeed if test passes
2. Improve Travis-CI script to only succeed if build succeeds
3. Move integration tests over from other project, get Travis-CI to run and only succeed if integration test passes
4. Generalize travis-CI unity build scripts for reuse
5. Add many more unit and integration tests
6. Fix issues with original project (collision doesn't kill player)
